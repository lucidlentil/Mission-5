# Mission-5
Create Version 1 of the designed application
Create an application based on the version of prototype design you received from UX Designers at the end of Week 1.  You can ask questions to clarify the design with UX Designer(s) as needed, but you do not need to incorporate any design changes made by your UX Designers in Week 2. 

Each developer will work on least ONE screen of the application that has both frontend and backend functionality. You are encouraged to work on more screens if time permits.

Your application will need to use a MongoDB backend, and be deployed using Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or Minikube.  You are encouraged to re-use the architecture in Week 1 by editing the code of the hello world application.

Collaborate using Github to discuss how to share common components amongst developers.
